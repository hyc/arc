 * Description: This file contains the routines used to encrypt and decrypt data
 * in an archive.  The encryption method is nothing fancy, being just a
 * routine XOR, but it is used on the packed data, and uses a variable length
 * key.  The end result is something that is in theory crackable, but I'd
 * hate to try it.  It should be more than sufficient for casual use.
