                        CHANGES IN VERSION 5.21


The following changes have been made in ARC version 5.21, but have not
yet been included in the manual:

o   When adding files to an archive, ARC now shows the stowage facter
    achieved on each file.

o   A bug was found that would keep an archive entry from being
    encrypted if it was stored without compression.  This has now been
    fixed.

o   If changes are made to a corrupted archive, the corrupted entries
    are discarded.  This makes it possible to lose data accidentally.
    ARC will now only make changes to a corrupted archive if the W
    (suppress Warnings) option has been given.

o   The N (suppress Notes) option now suppresses the "Creating
    archive" note when a new archive is being created.

o   The N (suppress Notes) option formerly did nothing useful when
    used with the L (List files) command.  It now causes a terse
    listing of filenames only, suitable for use with pipes and
    redirection.

o   The list of filenames given to ARC may now include indirect
    references.  If a filename begins with an "at sign" ("@"), it is
    taken to be the name of a file which contains a list of file
    names.  The list of file names may include further indirection.
    If no extension is given, ".CMD" is assumed.  For example, the
    command:

         arc a waste junk.txt @trash

    would cause ARC to add JUNK.TXT plus all files listed in the file
    TRASH.CMD to an archive named WASTE.ARC.  If no file is specified,
    then the list is read from standard input.  For example, the
    command:

         arc ln waste | arc a trash @

    would cause ARC to add files to TRASH.ARC based on the names of
    the files stored in WASTE.ARC.  It is probably a good idea to give
    the O (Overwrite) option if you are extracting files this way.

    Version 5.21 of MARC also allows for indirection.
